# Knossos-Release-Page
A small repo for the release page of KnossosNet

The most recent release's builds are split by os.  The page also automatically detects the current OS in order to simplify the process of choosing a build for users.  Some Windows ARM users will still see the site pick x64 builds based on the browser in use, but those builds can run on ARM via emulation.
